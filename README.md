PowSyBl (**Pow**er **Sy**stem **Bl**ocks) is an open source framework written in Java, that makes it easy to write complex
software for power systemsâ€™ simulations and analysis. Its modular approach allows developers to extend or customize its
features.

PowSyBl is part of the LF Energy Foundation, a project of The Linux Foundation that supports open source innovation projects
within the energy and electricity sectors.

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [PowSyBl Code of Conduct](https://github.com/powsybl/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [powsybl-tsc@lists.lfenergy.org](mailto:powsybl-tsc@lists.lfenergy.org).

## Environment requirements
The project contains both Java and C++ modules. If you are only interested in the Slurm computation manager, you can build
the Java part only. If you're also interested in the MPI computation manager, you need to compiler C++ modules also.

To build the Java modules, you need the following requirements:
- JDK *(17 or greater)*
- Maven *(3.8.0 or greater)* - you could use the embedded maven wrapper instead if you prefer (see [Using Maven Wrapper](#using-maven-wrapper))

```
$> yum install java-17-openjdk maven 
```

To build the C++ modules, you need the additional requirements:
- CMake *(2.6 or greater)*
- A recent C++ compiler (GNU g++ or Clang)
- OpenMPI *(1.8.3 or greater)*
- Some development packages (zlib, bzip2)

```
$> yum install bzip2 bzip2-devel cmake gcc-c++ make wget zlib-devel
```

### OpenMPI 
In order to support the MPI modules, you need to compile and install the [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) library.
```
$> wget https://download.open-mpi.org/release/open-mpi/v1.8/openmpi-1.8.3.tar.bz2
$> tar xjf openmpi-1.8.3.tar.bz2
$> cd openmpi-1.8.3
$> ./configure --prefix=<INSTALL_DIR> --enable-mpi-thread-multiple
$> make install
$> export PATH=$PATH:<INSTALL_DIR>/bin
$> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<INSTALL_DIR>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

## Build

### Simple Java Build
If you are interested in the Slurm computation manager only, you can easily compile the project using the following command:
```
$> mvn package
```

### Full Build
We provide a toolchain to help people to build this project. This toolchain downloads thirdparties (boost, libarchive,
log4cpp, protobuf) from the Intenet, compiles both Java and C++ modules and create an iTools distribution. It's a
standalone external folder that contains all the built objects required to run powsybl programs through the itools
command-line interface. This repository contains the `install.sh` script to do so easily. By default, the `install.sh`
will download dependencies from the Internet, compile code and finally copy the resulting iTools distribution to the
installation folder.
```
$> ./install.sh
```
This will run both the C++ build and the java build and copy their results to the installation folder.

A more detailed description of the `install.sh` script options follows:

#### Targets

| Target | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| clean | Clean modules |
| clean-thirdparty | Clean the thirdparty libraries |
| compile | Compile modules |
| package | Compile modules and create a distributable package |
| __install__ | __Compile modules and install it__ |
| docs | Generate the documentation (Doxygen/Javadoc) |
| help | Display this help |

#### Options

The install.sh script options are saved in the *install.cfg* configuration file. This configuration file is loaded and
updated each time you use the install.sh script.

#### Global options

| Option | Description | Default value |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| --help | Display this help | |
| --prefix | Set the installation directory | $HOME/powsybl |
| --mvn | Set the maven command to use | mvn | 

#### Third-parties

| Option | Description | Default value |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| --with-thirdparty | Enable the compilation of thirdparty libraries | |
| --without-thirdparty | Disable the compilation of thirdparty libraries | |
| --thirdparty-prefix | Set the thirdparty installation directory | $HOME/powsybl_thirdparty |
| --thirdparty-download | Sets false to compile thirdparty libraries from a local repository | true |
| --thirdparty-packs | Sets the thirdparty libraries local repository | $HOME/powsybl_packs |

#### Default configuration file
```
#  -- Global options --
powsybl_prefix=$HOME/powsybl

#  -- Thirdparty libraries --
thirdparty_build=true
thirdparty_prefix=$HOME/powsybl_thirdparty
thirdparty_download=true
thirdparty_packs=$HOME/powsybl_packs
```

## Using Maven Wrapper
If you don't have a proper Maven installed, you could use the [Apache Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/)
scripts provided. They will download a compatible maven distribution and use it automatically.

### Configuration
#### Configure the access to the maven distributions
In order to work properly, Maven Wrapper needs to download 2 artifacts: the maven distribution and the maven wrapper
distribution. By default, these are downloaded from the online Maven repository.

##### Internet access authentication
If your internet access requires a Basic Authentication, you should define the following variables in your environment:
- `MVNW_USERNAME`: the username;
- `MVNW_PASSWORD`: the password.

##### Using a Maven Repository Manager
If you prefer to use an internal Maven Repository Manager, you should define the following variable in your environment:
- `MVNW_REPOURL`: the URL to your repository manager (for instance `https://my_server/repository/maven-public`)

Note that if you need to use this variable, it must be set for **each maven command**. Else, the Maven Wrapper will try to
retrieve the maven distribution from the online Maven repository (even if one was already downloaded from another location).

##### Checking your access configuration
You could check your configuration with the following command:
```shell
./mvnw -version
```

If you encounter any problem, you could specify `MVNW_VERBOSE=true` and relaunch the command to have
further information.

#### Configuring `install.sh` to use maven wrapper
To indicate `install.sh` to use Maven Wrapper, you need to configure it with the `--mvn` option:
```shell
./install.sh clean --mvn ./mvnw
```

You can revert this configuration with the following command:
```shell
./install.sh clean --mvn mvn
```

### Usage
Once the configuration is done, you just need to use `./mvnw` instead of `mvn` in your commands.
